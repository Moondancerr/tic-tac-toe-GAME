# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game (Console + Web)

A simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe in:

- 🐍 Python (Console-based 2-player game)
- 🌐 HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Browser-based interactive game)

---

## 🐍 Console Version

- Run `python tictactoe.py`
- 2-player local game in the terminal
- Win and draw detection included

---

## 🌐 Web Version

- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Click cells to play X and O alternately
- Basic UI with no win/draw logic yet (WIP)

---

## 📦 To Do

- [ ] Add win/draw logic to web version  
- [ ] Add game reset button  
- [ ] Improve Python input validation  
- [ ] Style the board (CSS polish)

---

Made for fun 💡
